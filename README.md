This is for DSAN-6500 course project repo include data to final output. 

## Project 2 Assignment

In the Google Drive, I added contributor assignments for each section of assignment description. Please choose Contributor 1, 2, or 3. Each Contributor should complete 1 to 1.5 pages. Contributor 2 can write a little less, but there is a little bit of coding required in Section 2.1.2. Contributor 3 writes 1.5 pages and can reference the publication included in the readings. We can work independently and then meet again to suggest ways to tie everything together. Some of the methods and results will be standard regardless the type of analysis in computer vision. We should be able to write based we have written in Project 1 Assignment. There are references included in Project 1 also for more ideas.  

Here is the link the Project 2 description with comments: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CYN_c7779s3vbjpBFgdhwVdN65mcG70L/edit

Tiana prefers Contributor 1. Please let me know if you would like to change anything around; I'm open to suggestions.  

Contributor 1 - Tiana
Contributor 2 - 
Contributor 3 - 

This is due for submission on Saturday June 22, but let's aim for Friday night, June 21. Ishaan is away starting Wednesday, June 19th, and can work on the assignment on June 17, 18.
